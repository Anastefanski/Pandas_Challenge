Heroes of Pymoli

You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
The Data Report Created Includes Each of the Following:

### Player Count

### Purchasing Analysis (Total)

### Gender Demographics

### Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

### Age Demographics

### Purchasing Analysis (age)

### Top Spenders

### Most Popular Items

### Most Profitable Items

The three most observable trends from this data analysis include the following: 
1.The majority of players are overwhelmingly male, at 84% of the total players
2. The most popular age bracket for this game are players ages between 20 and 24.
3. Players in the age bracket of 20 to 24 are willing to spend the money to continue gaming, thus knowing that marketing to that demographic is profitable.
4. Alternatively, the fact that there is such a low percentage of female gamers presents an opportunity to tap into that demographic to expand your base, and tap into another stream of revenue since that potential is untapped.
